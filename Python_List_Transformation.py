#Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice list operations and transformations. Problem Statement: You've been given a list of grades from an exam. You need to process and analyze these grades.
#Task 1: Sort the grades in descending order and print the sorted list. Task 2: Calculate the average grade and print it.

grades = [85, 90, 78, 88, 76, 95, 89, 80, 72, 93]
grades.sort()
print(grades)

average = (85+90+78+88+76+95+89+80+72+93)/10
print(average)
